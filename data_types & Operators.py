# # Let's see the data types in action

# # a = 24 # Int

# # c = 5.5 # float

# # # Let's check the boolean values
# # print(a > b)
# #print(a < b)
# #
# # # Let's look at some builtin methods for boolean
# # greetings = "Hello world!"
# # # isalpha() helps us find if the variable holding letters
# # print(greetings.isalpha())
# #
# # # islower() checks if the statement in lower case
# # print(greetings.islower())

# # print(greetings.endswith("!"))
# # print(greetings.startswith("H"))
# # In SQL we have seen Null but in Python we have None which is a key word in python
